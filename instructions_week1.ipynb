    "## Python refresher workshop 1\n",
    "\n",
    "During this workshop (spanning four weeks), we will build a few different syllabification systems, i.e. models which can split words into sequences of syllables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aɪ s l ə n d ə  ->  aɪ s . l ə n . d ə\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first meeting, we will focus on data processing and evaluation. We'll also implement a  baseline syllabification algorithm. A baseline model is essentially a simple model that acts as a reference in a machine learning project. Our baseline will simply chunk the input into segments of two characters (with an optional single character segment at the end):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aɪ s l ə n d ə  ->  aɪ s . l ə . n d . ə\n",
    "t͡ʃ aɪ n ə t aʊ n z   t͡ʃ aɪ . n ə . t aʊ . n z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously not a great result. For example, `n d` is a pretty weird syllable.  However, this will give us a baseline performance that we can compare to when we start developing more complex syllabification systems. Any reasonable syllabifier needs to be able to beat this simple baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to work on the exercises in pairs or small teams (though you can also work individually if you prefer). For people with no python experience, it's a good idea to team up with someone who is a bit more experienced.  \n",

    "\n",
    "These materials should take you pretty far, but googling can also be useful. You are also very welcome to ask each other, Miikka and Roger for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are hints in the notebook which you can view by clicking on the hint. It's probably a good idea to try first and look at the hint if you need additional help.\n",
